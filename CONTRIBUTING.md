## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the development environment set up:

```bash
# Install Rust nightly
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly

# Add RISC-V target
rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf

# Install QEMU
sudo apt install qemu-system-riscv64  # Ubuntu/Debian
# or
brew install qemu                      # macOS
```

### First-Time Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/elinOS.git
   cd elinOS
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/elinOS.git
   ```
4. **Test the build**:
   ```bash
   make build
   make run
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/original-owner/elinOS/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
- Check `help wanted` for areas where we need assistance
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

#### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow Rust idioms and best practices
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Add `#![no_std]` compatible code only
- Prefer safe abstractions over unsafe code

#### Example of Good Code Style:

```rust
/// Allocates memory using the most appropriate allocator for the given size
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `size` - Number of bytes to allocate (must be > 0)
/// * `alignment` - Required alignment (must be power of 2)
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(ptr)` - Non-null pointer to allocated memory
/// * `Err(AllocError)` - Allocation failed
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// let ptr = allocate_aligned_memory(1024, 16)?;
/// // Use the memory...
/// deallocate_memory(ptr, 1024);
/// ```
pub fn allocate_aligned_memory(size: usize, alignment: usize) -> AllocResult<NonNull<u8>> {
    if size == 0 || !alignment.is_power_of_two() {
        return Err(AllocError::InvalidParameters);
    }
    
    // Implementation...
}
```

#### Safety Guidelines

Always document `unsafe` blocks:

```rust
unsafe {
    // SAFETY: ptr is guaranteed to be valid because:
    // 1. It was just allocated by our allocator
    // 2. We verified it's non-null above
    // 3. The size matches what we allocated
    core::ptr::write(ptr, value);
}
```

### 4. Testing

Run the full test suite before submitting:

```bash
# Run all tests
make check-all

# Specific test categories
make test           # Unit tests
make integration    # Integration tests
make clippy         # Linting
make format         # Code formatting
```

Add tests for new functionality:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_memory_allocation_basic() {
        let ptr = allocate_memory(1024);
        assert!(ptr.is_some());
        
        // Test writing to the memory
        if let Some(addr) = ptr {
            unsafe {
                *(addr as *mut u8) = 42;
                assert_eq!(*(addr as *const u8), 42);
            }
            deallocate_memory(addr, 1024);
        }
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_zero_size_allocation() {
        let ptr = allocate_memory(0);
        assert!(ptr.is_none());
    }
}
```

### 5. Documentation

Update documentation for any user-facing changes:

- Update inline documentation for public APIs
- Add examples to doc comments
- Update relevant files in `docs/` directory
- Consider adding entries to the README if significant

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "memory: Add aligned allocation support

- Implement allocate_aligned_memory() function
- Add support for power-of-2 alignments up to page size
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Update documentation with usage examples

Fixes #123"
```

### 7. Submit a Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Then create a PR on GitHub
```
