# elinOS

**Language / ËØ≠Ë®Ä**: [English](README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh.md)

An **experimental** RISC-V operating system written in Rust, featuring dynamic memory management, well-organized system call architecture, VirtIO device support, filesystem operations, and **ELF program execution capability**. Perfect for **learning**, **research**, and **educational purposes**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Build and run elinOS
make
./run.sh
```

**What you'll see:**
- Interactive shell with comprehensive commands
- Professional system call architecture (9 categories, 15+ syscalls)
- File system operations (create, read, delete files)
- VirtIO device discovery and management
- ELF binary loading and analysis
- System information and memory management

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üèó **Clean Architecture**
- **Range-based syscall organization** (1-50: File I/O, 51-70: Directory, etc.)
- **Well-structured design** with 9 distinct categories
- **Type-safe implementation** leveraging Rust's safety features

### üíæ **Memory Management**
- **Dynamic memory detection** via OpenSBI
- **Adaptive heap configuration** based on available RAM
- **Per-hart stack allocation** (supports up to 4 RISC-V cores)
- **Memory-safe operations** with bounds checking

### üîß **Device & I/O Support**
- **VirtIO block device** driver with automatic discovery
- **MMIO-based device probing** at standard addresses
- **Block device abstraction** for future filesystem integration
- **Serial UART** communication and debugging

### üìÅ **Filesystem Operations**
- **In-memory filesystem** with POSIX-like operations
- **File management commands** (ls, cat, touch, rm)
- **Dynamic file creation** and deletion
- **Extensible design** for real filesystem support

### üîÑ **ELF Program Support**
- **Complete ELF64 loader** with validation and parsing
- **Program header analysis** and segment information
- **Memory-safe ELF processing** using Rust type system
- **Ready for execution** (foundation for future virtual memory)

## üñ• Interactive Demo

Once elinOS boots, explore its capabilities:

```bash
elinOS> help                    # Show all available commands
elinOS> version                 # Display elinOS version info
elinOS> memory                  # View memory layout
elinOS> devices                 # Probe VirtIO devices
elinOS> syscall                 # Show system call architecture
elinOS> ls                      # List filesystem contents
elinOS> cat hello.txt           # Display file contents
elinOS> elf-info hello.elf      # Analyze ELF binary structure
elinOS> elf-load hello.elf      # Load ELF into memory
elinOS> shutdown                # Graceful system shutdown
```

## üéØ Current Capabilities
